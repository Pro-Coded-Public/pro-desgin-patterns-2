The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

In the context of .NET programming, the Factory Method pattern can be particularly useful due to the strong typing of the language and the need for creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

Here's a basic example of how the Factory Method pattern might be implemented in C#:

```csharp
// The Product abstract class
public abstract class Product
{
}

// Concrete Products
public class ConcreteProductA : Product
{
}

public class ConcreteProductB : Product
{
}

// The Creator abstract class
public abstract class Creator
{
    public abstract Product FactoryMethod();
}

// Concrete Creators
public class ConcreteCreatorA : Creator
{
    public override Product FactoryMethod()
    {
        return new ConcreteProductA();
    }
}

public class ConcreteCreatorB : Creator
{
    public override Product FactoryMethod()
    {
        return new ConcreteProductB();
    }
}
```

In this `FactoryMethod` pattern example, `Product` is the abstract base class, `ConcreteProductA` and `ConcreteProductB` are concrete products. `Creator` is the abstract creator class that declares the factory method, which returns an object of the `Product` type. `ConcreteCreatorA` and `ConcreteCreatorB` are concrete creators that override the factory method to change the resulting product's type.
