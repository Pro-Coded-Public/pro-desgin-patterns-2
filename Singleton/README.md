The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance. It's particularly useful when a single object is required to control actions.

In the context of .NET programming, the Singleton pattern can be particularly useful due to the strong typing of the language and the need for controlling simultaneous access to shared resources.

Here's a basic example of how the Singleton pattern might be implemented in C#:

```csharp
public sealed class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton _instance = null;
    private static readonly object padlock = new object();

    Singleton()
    {
    }

    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            lock (padlock)
            {
                if (_instance == null)
                {
                    _instance = new Singleton();
                }
                return _instance;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `Singleton` is the class that has only one instance. The instance is created when the `Instance` property is called for the first time. The `lock` keyword ensures that one thread doesn't enter the critical section while another thread is in the critical section. If another thread attempts to enter a locked code, it will wait, block, until the object is released.
